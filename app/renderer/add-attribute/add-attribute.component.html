<h4>Add attribute to element experiments</h4>
<card>
  This experiement demonstrations how to add an attribute to an element using the Renderer API.
  <p>
    I suspect that using more "typical" angular methods for settings attributes should probably typically be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example one could use binding: <code>[att.attribute-name]="attribute-value"</code>.

<div #add id="add-attribute-div">
  This class should have an attribute added to it during the AfterViewInit phase.  The attribute should
  set the color red.
</div>
