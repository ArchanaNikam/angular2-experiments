<h5>Explanation</h5>

<strong>How content queries (and @Query) queries are evaluated</strong>
Content Queries are performed on the data that is contained within the Component element.  For example:

<pre>
  <code>
    &lt;component>
      <item #varname>Anything within the component element is selectable.</item>
    &lt;/component>
  </code>
</pre>

In the example above the item element is queryable.  If there is a Component for <em>item</em> then
queries can be constructed that can select the Components.  See the code for how to create the queries.

In addition elements can be selected by selecting on variable bindings.  In the example that is: <em>varname</em>.

Content Queries are performed on the content of the Component, after the content has been processed but before
the Component has been processed.  This means that the data can be accessed at early phases such as ngOnInit.
